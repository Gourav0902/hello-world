Hi, I am Gouravjeet Singh. I  came to Canada last year as an international student and I have completed my diploma in electronics and communications back in India and currently I am pursuing  diploma in electronics engineering technician. I am a dynamic person with practical approach. I have just turned 22, but I believe that I am mature enough to make my livelihood myself and support my family, that is why I have come to Canada to broaden up my horizons. If I talk about my strength, I am an open-minded person and I am always curious to learn something new and creative. On the other hand, I get overwhelmed sometimes.
